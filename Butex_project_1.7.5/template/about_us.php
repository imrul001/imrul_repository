        <p>Bangladesh University of Textiles is the only public university among all textile universities in Bangladesh established in order to meet the growing need for advanced Textile Engineering education in Bangladesh as well as in the world. Though the university was established on 22nd December, 2010 by an ordinance of Education Ministry, it has a long glorious history. During the British Colonial Rule in 1921 a Weaving School was established in Narinda, Dhaka to meet textile technical education by offering artisan level courses. It was named East Bengal Textile Institute and started offering diploma courses in Textile Technology. Later, it was named East Pakistan Textile Institute in 1950. In 1960, the institute was transferred to its present campus at Tejgaon I/A. In 1978, the institute launched the 4 years bachelor degree program in Textile Technology in affiliation with the University of Dhaka and was renamed as College of Textile Technology. Currently, the university offers graduate programs in six different specialization areas to prepare its students for their career life. Graduate Programs in Textiles Engineering has been lunched in July, 2011. This University has 11.67 acres land with large infrastructure including 86,800 sq. ft area for academic and administration, 15 Workshops, and 84,000 sq. ft area for laboratories. A development project to improve infrastructure is under process for approval.</p>
