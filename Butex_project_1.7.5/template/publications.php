            <p>Shimla Hills is a renowned name in the industry catering to the export of Mango Pulp. The product is manufactured with the help of modern machineries to yield the best quality extract of the class-apart mangoes. The mangoes are harvested using the most novel controlled methods as well as longstanding processes to make them full-grown in a natural way. This makes sure that the mangoes retain their natural sweetness, fragrance, and shade in the fruit as well as in the Mango Pulp. At Shimla Hills, the product is processed in total hygienic conditions to ensure that all specifications, as laid down by the international bodies are matched properly. The Mango Pulp has a standardised free flowing outward show which is made to ensure that the product is processed under equal circumstances and temperatures.</p>
